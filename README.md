## About this Plugin
A simple plugin to scout the next dungoeon/trial/raid (instance to be generic) you are going to enter.<br>
*It still supports Windows 10 toasts but major focus of this fork will be push notifications.*<br>
At the moment push notifications via Telegram and Pushbullet are supported. 
If you find any bug or have any idea to share and optimize the plugin fill free to contact me or open an Issue (:

### Why this fork?!?
I love what [easly1989](https://github.com/easly1989/ffxiv_act_dfassist) has done but yesterday I missed Duty Finder instance because I left computer for a minute.<br>
I think if Duty Finder assist plugin sends a real time notification to my phone I can run to the computer and get the Duty Finder instance in time!
